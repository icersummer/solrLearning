			<str name="book_description">If you are new to Unix, this concise book will tell you
				just what you need to get started and no more. Unix was one of the
				first operating systems written in C, a high-level programming
				language, and its natural portability and low price made it a
				popular choice among universities. Initially, two main dialects of
				Unix existed: one produced by AT&amp;T known as System V, and one
				developed at UC Berkeley and known as BSD. In recent years, many
				other dialects have been created, including the highly popular Linux
				operating system and the new Mac OS X (a derivative of BSD).Learning
				the Unix Operating System is a handy book for someone just starting
				with Unix or Linux, and it s an ideal primer for Mac and PC users of
				the Internet who need to know a little about Unix on the systems
				they visit. The fifth edition is the most effective introduction to
				Unix in print, covering Internet usage for email, file transfers,
				web browsing, and many major and minor updates to help the reader
				navigate the ever-expanding capabilities of the operating system: In
				response to the popularity of Linux, the book now focuses on the
				popular bash shell preferred by most Linux users. Since the release
				of the fourth edition, the Internet and its many functions has
				become part of most computer user s lives. A new chapter explains
				how to use ftp, pine for mail, and offers useful knowledge on how to
				surf the web. Today everyone is concerned about security. With this
				in mind, the author has included tips throughout the text on
				security basics, especially in the Internet and networking sections.
				The book includes a completely updated quick reference card to make
				it easier for the reader to access the key functions of the command
				line.

				OS X and more varieties of Linux than you can easily name.The latest
				edition of this bestselling reference brings Unix into the 21st
				century. It s been reworked to keep current with the broader state
				of Unix in today s world and highlight the strengths of this
				operating system in all its various flavors.Detailing all Unix
				commands and options, the informative guide provides generous
				descriptions and examples that put those commands in context. Here
				are some of the new features you ll find in Unix in a Nutshell,
				Fourth Edition: Solaris 10, the latest version of the SVR4-based
				operating system, GNU/Linux, and Mac OS X; Bash shell (along with
				the 1988 and 1993 versions of ksh); tsch shell (instead of the
				original Berkeley csh); Package management programs, used for
				program installation on popular GNU/Linux systems, Solaris and Mac
				OS X; GNU Emacs Version 21; Introduction to source code management
				systems; Concurrent versions system; Subversion version control

				recognize the value of this complete, up-to-date Unix reference.
